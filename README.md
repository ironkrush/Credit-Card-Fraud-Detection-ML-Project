# Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection

## Description

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection project! This Python-based solution leverages the power of NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn (imblearn) to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilize Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilize scikit-learn to train and deploy machine learning models for fraud detection, leveraging algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or support vector machines.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Address imbalanced class distribution using techniques provided by imbalanced-learn to improve the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Evaluation:** Employ various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the fraud detection models.
- **Scalability:** Design the solution to handle large volumes of credit card transaction data efficiently, ensuring scalability and robustness.
